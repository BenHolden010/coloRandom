### Learning Goals:

The learning goals of this project were to practice creating a website using javascript, CSS, and HTML from blank files into a functional and aesthetic web page.

### Wins + Challenges:

Wins: During this project we sstarted with the HTML and CSS file then began writing javascript code. This helped us visualize how we would manipulate the structure of the web page to get the desired functionality before we even started the logic.

Challenges: we faced challenges getting the images to change but we were able to use a hidden class in css that would display none. we also had challlenges creating a way to delete certain palettes from the saved palette section but we were able to use the splice method on out data model and return the rest of the saved arrays to the data model and display them on the saved section.
